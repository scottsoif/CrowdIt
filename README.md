# CrowdIt

CrowdIt is an IOS app written in swift. CrowdIt works on a crowdsourcing scheme. Users have the app run in the background, while our app anonymously tracks the stores you enter. With this data any user on the app can see live how many people are currently in a specific store. CrowdIt will allow users to more comfortably leave their homes during these coronavirus uncertain times. Our app's users and partners will know exactly when to go food shoppin or any other errand.

## Coming Soon
CrowdIt will soon provide users with notifications when their favorites stores empty out and become less crowded.

## Comments or Concerns
Leave a pull request and we'll follow up at soon as time allows.
