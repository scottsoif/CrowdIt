# CrowdIt

## COVID-19 Inspired

CrowdIt is an IOS app written in swift. CrowdIt works using a crowdsourcing scheme. Users allow the app run in the background. CrowdIt anonymously tracks the stores you enter. With this data any user on the app can see live how many people are currently in a specific store. CrowdIt will allow users to more comfortably leave their homes during these coronavirus uncertain times. Our app's users and partners will know exactly when to go food shoppin or any other errand.
